The approach we took first began by analyzing the map to see what our best course
of action would be. The way we did this by trying various different seed combinations
in order to see what patterns are emerging with the different seed combinations. In order
to better see how the maps differed we took screenshots of the maps generated and began to see a pattern.
The pattern we noticed was that the floor, and the vertical beams remained the same no matter seed we chose.
In addition we noticed that when we changed the seeds the only thing that changed was the horizontal beams.
In addition, we noticed that the although it says the starting position might change, we didn't notice any 
change from where the bot started when we tried countless of seeds. Therefore, we designed a strategy that 
used the patterns we found in mind.

The approach we began with was by writing a map generalized model that goes through the vertical beams and the floor.
Following this approach we clean the sufficient amount of tiles and several windows. They we went about
implementing this model was by creating helper functions that performed one action. For instance we had a move south
function that moved the bot south by a given amount. Given that we had a generalized approached working be began to 
optimize our code to account for more randomness that we could not get from the seeds we chose to generate. We began by
attempting to add interrupt handlers for various actions. Unfortunately we weren't able to incorporate the interrupt handlers in 
our generalized model so we did not incorporate them into our final submission.

Overall, we worked on this lab as a team to come up with our best approach that we think should qualify. We are pretty satisfied with our
map generalized model that we came up with because of the vast amount of research we did from creating various maps and seeds so that we could find
patterns with the map generation.
